# TASK DESCRIPTION

For this task, you will be creating a products page for a website that sells guitars. You can use this as inspiration: ["Thomann"](https://www.thomann.de/gb/lp_models.html).

Based on the example above, you are going to implement the list of products only. The filters section is not mandatory, you can implement it as a bonus step if you have time.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Create a single page application in a framework of your choosing (React.JS, Angular,
   Vue.JS etc.). You can scaffold the application using a command line command.

2. Inside the application, you will need to create a JSON file containing some FAQ data.
   Name the file guitars.json. The data will be provided below.

3. Once that is finished, create a service that retrieves the information from the file at point
   #2. Ideally, you should use a service like axios or HttpClient and the HTTP method should be GET.

4. Display the data on the page.

5. Using Bootstrap, another framework of your choice, or custom CSS that you write from
   scratch, style the page to mimic the style from the example above.

6. Make sure the solution is also responsive and adaptive, i.e. elements change size and position based on screen resolution so that it looks good on any device and on any resolution.

THINGS TO CONSIDER:

• The JSON file is there to mimic a server call, so please remember to read the info using axios as you would invoke an API/server

• You can search for any questions you have regarding the documentation of the frameworks you decide to use.

• You can create as many components as you like.

• You can use any extra frameworks you like (i.e. fontawesome, bootstrap, tailwind, etc.).

• How you organize and document your code is important, so please pay attention to
leave it in an orderly manner.
